# LEGATO-reproduce-decoder-only
Reproduction of LEGATO (Large-scale End-to-end Generalizable Approach to Typeset OMR). Includes bug fixes, a simplified inference script, and a full environment/reproduction evidence pack. Decoder part verified – generates ABC notation. (Vision encoder excluded due to network constraints, can be skipped for core validation.)
